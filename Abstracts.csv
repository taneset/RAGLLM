Abstract
"There is an unknown but probably small probability that the West-Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) will collapse because of
anthropogenic climate change. A WAIS collapse could cause a5-6metre global sea level rise within centuries. In three case studies,
we investigate the response of society to the most extreme yet not implausible scenario, a five-metre sea level rise within a century,
starting in 2030. The case studies combine a series of interviews with experts and stakeholders with a gaming workshop. In the
1 Rhone delta, the most likely option would be retreat, with economic losses, perhaps social losses, and maybe ecological gains. In the
Thames estuary, the probable outcome is less clear, but would probably be a mix of protection, accommodation and retreat, with
parts of the city centre turned into a Venice of London. A massive downstream barrier is an alternative response. In the Rhine delta
(the Netherlands), the initial response would be protection, followed by retreat from the economically less important parts of the
country and, probably, from Amsterdam-Rotterdam metropolitan region as well. These impacts are large compared to other climate
change impacts, but probably small compared to the impacts of the same scenario in other parts of the"
"Abstract Extreme weather events have been increasingly in the news, accompanied by images. At the end of 2011, when
such reports were ever present, the International Panel on Climate Change published a draft report on extreme weather and climate
change adaptation. This report itself was covered in the news and illustrated with images. Some of these depicted 'extreme weather',
in particular with relation to floods, droughts and heat waves, hurricanes and ice/sea-level rise. For this article, these images were
studied using visual thematic analysis, with a focus on examining the way they may symbolise certain emotional responses, such as
compassion, fear, guilt, vulnerability, helpless, courage or resilience. Climate change communicators have examined the way that
evoking such emotions in verbal communication can lead to engagement or disengagements with the topic of climate change.
However, while researchers have also become increasingly interested in climate change images, they have not yet studied them with
respect to symbolising certain emotions. Various typologies of images have been proposed in the past, distinguishing, for example"
"We present research from an investigation on developing a learning progression (LP) for sea level rise (SLR), a major effect
of global climate change. We began our research by drafting a hypothetical LP for sea level rise, informed by extant knowledge of the
topic in the scientific community, in science education literature, and in science education policy documents such as the Next
Generation Science Standards. Causes and mechanisms, scale and representations, and impacts made up the three components of
the LP. Our confidence in our hypothetical LP was greater for the lower and upper anchors than for the levels between them. For all
levels, however, we remained tentative due to the limitation of empirical data from learners. We next developed an assessment
instrument as well as an on line activity as a way to elicit learners' thinking about sea level rise. These instruments were
administered to middle school students (N = 95) and undergraduate pre-service teachers (N = 77). An analysis of the data suggested
that our hypothetical LP for sea level rise was a necessary first step, but it underscored the necessity of probing learners' thinking of the construct to develop a robust understanding of learners' conceptual understanding overtime of SLR. The assessment data"
"In April 2011, we published the first peer-reviewed analysis of the greenhouse gas footprint (GHG) of
shale gas, concluding that the climate impact of shale gas may be worse than that of other fossil fuels such as coal
and oil because of methane emissions. We noted the poor quality of publicly available data to support our analysis
and called for further research. Our paper spurred a large increase in research and analysis, including several new
studies that have better measured methane emissions from natural gas systems. Here, I review this new research
in the context of our 2011 paper and the fifth assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
released in 2013. The best data available now indicate that our estimates of methane emission from both shale gas
and conventional natural gas were relatively robust. Using these new, best available data and a 20-year time
period for comparing the warming potential of methane to carbon dioxide, the conclusion stands that both shale
gas and conventional natural gas have a larger GHG than do coal or oil, for any possible use of natural gas and
particularly for the primary uses of residential and commercial heating. The 20-year time period is"
"Scientists believe significant climate change is unavoidable without a drastic reduction in the emissions
of greenhouse gases from the combustion of fossil fuels. However, few countries have implemented
comprehensive policies that price this externality or devote serious resources to developing low-carbon energy
sources. In many respects, the world is betting that we will greatly reduce the use of fossil fuels because we will run
out of inexpensive fossil fuels (there will be decreases in supply) and/or technological advances will lead to the
discovery of less-expensive low-carbon technologies (there will be decreases in demand). The historical record
indicates that the supply of fossil fuels has consistently increased over time and that their relative price advantage
over low-carbon energy sources has not declined substantially over time. Without robust efforts to correct the
market failures around greenhouse gases, relying on supply and/or demand forces to limit greenhouse gas
emissions is relying heavily on hope."
"Currently, over 80% of the energy used by mankind comes from fossil fuels. Harnessing coal, oil and gas,
the energy resources contained in the store of our spaceship, Earth, has prompted a dramatic expansion in energy use and a substantial improvement in the quality of life of billions of individuals in some regions of the world. the quality of life, but it also entails severe consequences

environmental legacy of fossil fuels is the most dramatic
problem posed by the relentless increase of global demand
Powering our civilization with fossil fuels has been very convenient, but now we know that it entails severe
consequences. We treat fossil fuels as a resource that anyone anywhere can extract and use in any fashion, and
Earth's atmosphere, soil and oceans as a dump for their waste products, including more than 30 Gt/y of carbon
dioxide. At present, environmental legacy rather than consistence of exploitable reserves, is the most dramatic
problem posed by the relentless increase of fossil fuel global demand. Harmful effects on the environment and
human health, usually not incorporated into the pricing of fossil fuels, include immediate and short-term impacts
related to their discovery, extraction, transportation, distribution, and burning as well as climate change that are
spread over time to future generations or over space to the entire planet. In this essay, several aspects of the fossil
fuel legacy are discussed,"
"Every nation of the world confirms that human-related greenhouse gas emissions are the major driver of
the present global climate change. About 20% populations of the world live in China and the emissions of
greenhouse gases of it are very high due to the large population, inefficient capital investment, heavy reliance on
coal and inefficient planed urbanization. China is now the second largest economy in the world, behind the USA
but at present it is facing severe environmental problems from its rapid economic growth. With the rapid economic
growth in China, the transportation sector is also growing rapidly, consequently increasing greenhouse gas
emissions due to over burning fossil fuels. China is the world's greatest coal producer and accounts for about 28%
of the world's total annual coal production. China is also the world's greatest coal consumer, accounting for more
than 26% of the world's total annual coal consumption. Experts from Chinese Academy for Environmental
Planning and Policy Research Center of State Environmental Protection Administration have taken various steps to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists expressed that global warming and climate change is due to increase
of greenhouse gas emissions. Hence the over greenhouse gas emissions of China is not only"
"Objective. We examine cognitive, economic, and partisan heuristic theories of why some people express
support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Methods. Data come from a mail survey of 623 residents of central
Pennsylvania, a region in which mitigation costs exceed potential benefits from slowing the rate of global warming.
Results. Ordinary least squares analysis shows that people who can accurately identify the causes of climate
change and who expect bad consequences from climate change are likely to support both government anti-fossil
fuel initiatives and voluntary actions. Economic circumstances and anxieties are not important predictors, but the
belief that environmental protection efforts do not threaten jobs for people like the respondent, limit personal
freedoms, and hurt the economy is a strong predictor. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support
government efforts to reduce emissions. Conclusions. Cognitive explanations of support for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions are more powerful than economic or partisan heuristic ones. People want to reduce emissions if
they understand the causes of climate change, if they perceive substantial risks from climate change if average
surface temperatures increase, and if they think climate change mitigation policies will not cost them their jobs."
"Certain gases that are capable of trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere are known as ""greenhouse
gas"" and are important for helping to regulate temperature. Major greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide,
methane, water vapor, chlorofluorocarbons, and nitrous oxide. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide as a
combustion product and atmospheric concentrations have increased dramatically over the past two centuries. The
heat trapped by this additional greenhouse gas is changing climates, melting ice sheets and glaciers in polar
regions, raising sea levels, and affecting ocean currents. Climate change can be mitigated by preventing the
emission of additional fossil fuel combustion products to the atmosphere and reducing existing greenhouse gas
levels back to pre-industrial revolution concentrations. This requires switching energy production to sustainable,
non-fossil sources and applying carbon capture, use, and storage technology on the fossil fuel combustion that
remains. The implementation of direct air capture technology to reduce existing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere
can further remediate climate impacts. Captured carbon dioxide can be stored in plant tissues, soils,
deep underground in geological repositories, or as solid materials like concrete or carbonates to keep it from reentering
the atmosphere. Although non-carbon energy sources have recently become more cost-competitive with
fossil..."
"The capture and separation of fluorinated gases (F-gases) from N2 has the potential to not only reduce
greenhouse gas emissions but also provide economic benefits for the semiconductor industry. In this work, two Nibased
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Ni-MOF (Ni(ina)2, ina = isonicotinic acid) and amine-functionalized NH2-
Ni-MOF (Ni(3-ain)2, 3-ain = 3-aminoisonicotinic acid), were constructed for capturing F-gases (CF4 and NF3). At
ambient conditions, both materials exhibit very high CF4 sorption capacities (2.92 mmol g-1 for Ni-MOF and 2.69
mmol g-1 for NH2-Ni-MOF). In addition, NH2-Ni-MOF exhibited a record selectivity of 46.3 for the CF4/N2 mixture at
298 Kand 100 kPa, surpassing all benchmark adsorbents, including Ni-MOF (34.7). The kinetic adsorption tests
demonstrated that Ni-MOF and NH2-Ni-MOF performed well for CF4/N2 and NF3/N2 mixtures. According to grand
canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, CF4 or NF3 interacts with NH2-Ni-MOF by multiple van der Waals
interactions, resulting in stronger interaction than N2. More importantly, dynamic breakthrough experiments
verified the practical separation potential of the two materials for CF4/N2 and NF3/N2 mixtures."
"Climate change may affect important environmental components of holiday destinations, which might have repercussions
for tourism-dependent economies. This study documents the importance of environmental attributes in determining the choice and
holiday enjoyment of tourists visiting Bona ire and Barbados, two Caribbean islands with markedly different tourism markets and
infrastructure. Three hundred and sixteen and 338 participants from Bona ire and Barbados, respectively, completed standardized
questionnaires. Warm temperatures, clear waters and low health risks were the most important environmental features determining
holiday destination choice. However, tourists in Bona ire thereafter prioritized marine wildlife attributes (i.e. coral and fish diversity
and abundance) over other environmental features, whereas tourists in Barbados exhibited stronger preferences for terrestrial
features, particularly beach characteristics. The willingness of tourists to revisit these islands was strongly linked to the state of the
preferred environmental attributes. More than 80% of tourists in Bona ire and Barbados would be unwilling to return for the same
holiday price in the event, respectively, of coral bleaching as a result of elevated sea surface temperatures and reduced beach area as
a result of sea level rise. Climate change might have a significant impact on Caribbean tourism economy through alteration of
environmental features important to destination selection. Island-specific management"
"Tourism is a major global economic sector that is undergoing tremendous growth in emerging economies and is often
touted as salient for development and poverty alleviation in developing countries. Tourism is recognized as a highly climate-sensitive
sector, one that is also strongly influenced by environmental and socioeconomic change influenced by climate change, and is also a
growing contributor to anthropogenic climate change. This article outlines the complex interrelationships between climate change
and the multiple components of the international tourism system. Five focal themes that have developed within the literature on the
consequences of climate change for tourism are then critically reviewed: climatic change and temporal and geographic shifts in
tourism demand, climate-induced environmental change and destination competitiveness within three major market segments
(winter sports tourism, coastal tourism, and nature-based tourism), and mitigation policy developments and future tourist mobility The review highlights the differential vulnerability of tourism destinations and that the resultant changes in competitiveness and
sustainability will transform some international tourism markets. Feedbacks throughout the tourism system mean that all
destinations will need to adapt to the risks and opportunities posed by climate change and climate policy. While notable progress has
been made in the last decade, a number of"
"We present a simulation model of the flow of tourists between 207 countries, used to study the impact of climate change on
international tourism. The model almost perfectly reproduces the calibration year 1995, and performs well in reproducing the
observations for 1980, 1985 and 1990. The model is used to generate scenarios of international tourist departures and arrivals for the
period 2000-2075, with particular emphasis on climate change; we report variations on a single baseline scenario (A1B). The growth
rate of international tourism is projected to increase over the coming decades, but may slow down later in the century, as demand for
travel saturates. Emissions of carbon dioxide would increase quickly as well. With climate change, preferred destinations would shift
to higher latitudes and altitudes. Tourists from temperate climates would spend more holidays in their home countries. As such
tourists currently dominate the international tourism market, climate change would decrease worldwide tourism. Nevertheless, its
effects are small compared to the baseline projections of population and economic growth."
"This paper addresses the implications of climate change for tourism through a survey of national tourism and
meteorological organisations. While climate change may have far-reaching consequences for tourism, it is shown that while most
respondents felt that climate is important to their country's tourism industry, very few were aware of climate change research
specifically related to tourism. Almost half felt climate change is or could become a significant issue in their country but almost no
climate change publications with direct bearing on tourism are available. It is concluded that climate is an important determinant of
tourism, and that global climate change may create new challenges, and opportunities, for the tourism industry. However, more
awareness, research, and policy analysis are necessary to reduce uncertainties, further understanding, assess implications and enable
the tourism industry to adapt to changing circumstances"
"This paper presents an overview of the relationship between tourism and global climate change. On the one hand, the
tourism industry may be one of the greatest economic victims of climate change. Yet, on the other hand, the broader tourism sector is
also a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. This study traces the evolution of academic interest in tourism and climate
change. Growth in this area has tracked growth in interest in climate change in general, with tourism-related papers representing
consistently about 0.5% of the published research on climate change"
"The relationship between tourism and changing climate has been discussed and studied for a relatively long time in
tourism research. Over the past 15 years, more focused studies have begun to appear, and especially recently, the issue of adaptation has been emphasised as an urgent research need in tourism and climate change studies. This paper is based on a systematic review of
the tourism and adaptation literature prior to 2012. It discusses adaptation challenges, the dimensions of vulnerability in a tourism
context and the implications of such studies on communities. By dividing the current adaptation studies into business; consumer;
destination; and policy- and framework-focused theme areas and traditions, the paper concludes that adaptation studies in tourism
have so far had a limited focus on community perceptions, which in general has been an area of major interest in tourism research.
More emphasis on community-based research in relation to tourism and climate change allows highly contextual adaptation
challenges to be met in a more sustainable way"
"Tourism is a climate-dependent industry, and many destinations owe their popularity to their pleasant climates during
traditional holiday seasons. This article explores the potential implications of climate change for global tourism, with special
emphasis on seasonality. Combination of two climate change scenarios with the Tourism Climatic Index reveals that the locations of
climatically ideal tourism conditions are likely to shift poleward under projected climate change. Whereas destinations such as the
Mediterranean may see shifts in their peak seasons from summer months to current shoulder periods, regions in higher latitudes are
likely to experience a lengthening of their summer seasons. The effects of these changes will depend greatly on the flexibility
demonstrated by institutions and tourists as they react to climate change, with substantial implications for both spatial and temporal
redistribution of tourism activities. The reader is referred to http://www.carrs.msu.edu/Main/People/faculty%20bios/extra/nicho210-
journal.pdf to view the full series of color maps accompanying these analyses."
"The intersection of tourism and climate change has seen significant research over the past two decades, focusing
particularly on issues of mitigation and adaptation in the global North. Research output has predominantly been centred on the
Mediterranean and Nordic countries and number of localities in North America. The global South has seen significantly less
investigation, despite having significantly lower adaptive capacity to the impacts of climate change, and numerous countries with
rapidly growing tourism sectors. The African continent specifically has seen appreciably less research than other countries in the
global South, despite arguably having the lowest adaptive capacity and projections of severe impacts of climate change to the tourism
sector from temperature increases, changes in precipitation volume and sea level rise. This paper therefore presents a review of the
existing literature on adaptation strategies of tourism sectors and participants in African countries. The crucial argument of this paper
is in highlighting the need for an increase in research into the threats of climate change to tourism in African countries, identifying
future research trajectories. The development of such knowledge would assist in the development of adaptation and mitigation
strategies for these most vulnerable tourism economies."
"The relation between changes in modern glaciers, not including the ice sheets of Greenland
and Antarctica, and their climatic environment is investigated to shed light on paleoglacier evidence
of past climate change and for projecting the effects of future climate warming on cold regions of the
world. Loss of glacier volume has been more or less continuous since the 19th century, but it is not a
simple adjustment to the end of an ""anomalous"" Little Ice Age. We address the 1961-1997 period,
which provides the most observational data on volume changes. These data show trends that are
highly variable with time as well as within and between regions; trends in the Arctic are consistent
with global averages but are quantitatively smaller. The averaged annual volume loss is 147 mm.yr(-1)
in water equivalent, totaling 3.7 x 10(3) km(3) over 37 yr. The time series shows a shift during the mid-
1970s, followed by more rapid loss of ice volume and further acceleration in the last decade; this is
consistent with climatologic data. Perhaps most significant is an increase in annual accumulation
along with an increase in melting; these produce a marked increase in the annual turnover or
amplitude. The rise in air"
"Despite recent research identifying a clear anthropogenic impact on glacier
recession, the effect of recent climate change on glacier-related hazards is
at present unclear. Here we present the first global spatio-temporal
assessment of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) focusing explicitly on
lake drainage following moraine dam failure. These floods occur as mountain
glaciers recede and downwaste. GLOFs can have an enormous impact on
downstream communities and infrastructure. Our assessment of GLOFs associated
with the rapid drainage of moraine-dammed lakes provides insights into the
historical trends of GLOFs and their distributions under current and future
global climate change. We observe a clear global increase in GLOF frequency
and their regularity around 1930, which likely represents a lagged response
to post-Little Ice Age warming. Notably, we also show that GLOF frequency and regularity- rather unexpectedly- have declined in recent decades
even during a time of rapid glacier recession. Although previous studies have
suggested that GLOFs will increase in response to climate warming and glacier
recession, our global results demonstrate that this has not yet clearly
happened. From an assessment of the timing of climate forcing, lag times in
glacier recession, lake formation and moraine-dam failure, we predict
increased GLOF frequencies during the next decades and into the 22nd
century."
"Climate change in the European Alps during the 20th century has been characterized by
increases in minimum temperatures of about 20C, a more modest increase in maximum temperatures,
little trend in precipitation data, and a general decrease of sunshine duration through to the mid-
1980s. Temperature increase has been most intense in the 1940s, followed by the 1980s. The warming
experienced since the early 1980s, while synchronous with the global warming, is of far greater
amplitude and reaches close to 1 OC for this ensemble average and up to 20C for individual sites. Such
changes caused pronounced effects in the glacial and periglacial belts. Since the middle of the past
century-the end of the Little Ice Age-the glacierization of the European Alps has lost about 30 to 40% in
surface area and around half its original volume. The estimated total glacier volume in the European
Alps was some 130 km3 for the mid-1970s, but strongly negative mass balances have caused an
additional loss of about 10 to 20% of this remaining ice volume since 1980. Periglacial permafrost in
the Alps today occupies an area comparable to the glacierized area and must have been affected as
well, but its .."
"Climate change has largely been understood as a biophysical, economic, and political
phenomenon. This approach has obscured the ways in which climate change also poses a challenge to
human subjective understandings of self and society in relation to place, and in relation to perceptions
of the sacred. Glaciers, as dominant features of high mountain landscapes, are sites of easily
observable consequences of climate change, grounding the consequences of distant carbon emissions
in material surroundings. They are also sites of powerful sacred and symbolic meanings for local
communities. This review examines three instances of glacial decline in sacred mountain landscapes,
in the Peruvian Andes, the Nepalese Himalaya, and the Meili Snow Mountains of Yunnan, China. These
examples show that glacial decline is not simply a material process, but also has important
implications for the ways that local people understand themselves and make meaning in relation to
their surroundings. Locally grounded values arising from particular experiences of the landscape,
especially from those most at risk from effects of climate change, may offer new avenues of ethical
reflection around climate change that can and should influence larger climate discourses."

"The aim of this paper is to provide the community with a comprehensive overview
of the studies of glaciers in the tropical Andes conducted in recent decades leading to the current
status of the glaciers in the context of climate change. In terms of changes in surface area and length we show that the glacier retreat in the tropical Andes over the last three decades is unprecedented
since the maximum extension of the Little Ice Age (LIA, mid-17th-early 18th century). In terms of
changes in mass balance, although there have been some sporadic gains on several glaciers, we show
that the trend has been quite negative over the past 50 yr, with a mean mass balance deficit for
glaciers in the tropical Andes that is slightly more negative than the one computed on a global scale. A
break point in the trend appeared in the late 1970s with mean annual mass balance per year
decreasing from -0.2 m w.e. in the period 1964-1975 to -0.76 m w.e. in the period 1976-2010. In
addition, even if glaciers are currently retreating everywhere in the tropical Andes, it should be noted
that this is much more pronounced on small glaciers at low"

"The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%-100%
of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper.
Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8
024024) based on 11944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause
of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a
97% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using
results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those
who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level
of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Toi also reduces the
apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global
warming ('no position') represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would
reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available
studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust
and consistent with other surveys ."
"While ecologists involved in management or policy often are advised to learn to deal
with uncertainty, there are a number of components of global environmental change of which we
are certain-certain that they are going on, and certain that they are human-caused. Some of these
are largely ecological changes, and all have important ecological consequences. Three of the welldocumented
global changes are: increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere;
alterations in the biogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle; and ongoing land use/land cover
change. Human activity-now primarily fossil fuel combustion- has increased carbon dioxide
concentrations from ""280 to 355 mL/L since 1800; the increase is unique, at least in the past 160 000
yr, and several lines of evidence demonstrate unequivocally that it is human-caused. This
increase is likely to have climatic consequences-and certainly it has direct effects on biota in all Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. The global nitrogen cycle has been altered by human activity to
such an extent that more nitrogen is fixed annually by humanity (primarily for nitrogen fertilizer,
also by legume crops and as a by product of fossil fuel combustion) than by all natural pathways
combined. This added nitrogen alters the chemistry of the atmosphere ."
"Global warming is one of the major consequences of the human activities where the
overuse of fossil fuels as energy resources caused the increase in the concentration of the
greenhouse gases {GHGs), such as CO2, CH4, N2O, and water vapor, in the atmosphere causing the
increase in the average surface temperature of the earth. This article reviews the driving forces of
global warming and highlights the major contributors to this phenomenon and presents some of
the mitigation techniques. Water vapor is responsible for two-third of the global warming;
however, CO2 is considered as the controlling factor of the global warming. In other words, if the
concentration of CO2 did not increase, global warming would not have happened. Scientists claim
that doubling or halving the CO2 in the atmosphere causes the change in the average surface
temperature of the earth by+ 3.8 °C or -3.6 °C, respectively. However, this amount of change
depends on the change in the humidity of the air which in return depends on the air's temperature.
Conversely, even though the other GHGs such as CH4 and N2O have stronger ability to absorb the
radiation, their contribution in the global warming is insignificant because of their low
concentration"
"Abstract The controversy between the I PCC and Non-governmental IPCC {NI PCC) on the
attribution of global warming are reviewed. IPCC holds that today's global warming is mainly due
to anthropogenic activities rather than natural variability, which is emphasized by NIPCC. The
surface temperature observations since the mid-20th century support the hypothesis of
anthropogenic impact, but for the last one hundred years or so, natural forcings such as solar
activity, volcanic eruptions and thermohaline circulation variations also have had great influences
on the Earth's climate, especially on inter-decadal timescales. In addition, evidence suggests that
the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA) are closely associated with the solar
activity over the past 1 thousand years. Over the past 10 thousand years, the North Atlantic cold
events and solar activity are closely correlated. Nevertheless, the physical mechanisms of the
solar-climate variability and interrelation are not well understood, yet. Notably, a prevailing view
recently indicates that galactic cosmic rays may result in climatic cooling through modulating
global low cloud cover. However, its process and mechanism need to be further investigated."
"There are many uncertainties concerning climate change, but a rough international
consensus has emerged that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from its pre-industrial
baseline is likely to lead to a 2.5 degree centigrade increase in the earth's mean surface
5 temperature by the middle of the next century. Such a warming would have diverse impacts on
human activities and would likely be catastrophic for many plants and nonhuman animals. The
author's contention is that the problems engendered by the possibility of climate change are not
purely scientific but also concern how we ought to live and how humans should relate to each
other and to the rest of nature; and these are problems of ethics and politics."

"The unprecedented outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus, termed as COVID-19 by the World Health
Organization (WHO), has placed numerous governments around the world in a precarious position. The impact
of the COVID-19 outbreak, earlier witnessed by the citizens of China alone, has now become a matter of grave
concern for virtually every country in the world. The scarcity of resources to endure the COVID-19 outbreak
combined with the fear of overburdened healthcare systems has forced a majority of these countries into a state
of partial or complete lockdown. The number of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases has been increasing at
an alarming rate throughout the world, with reportedly more than 3 million confirmed cases as of 30 April 2020.
Adding to these woes, numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus,
are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. In response to such acts, we draw on various
reliable sources to present a detailed review of all the major aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In
addition to the direct health implications associated with the outbreak of COVID-19, this study highlights its
impact on the global economy. In drawing things to a close, we explore the"
"Abstract Background Social media platforms have long been recognised as major disseminators of
health misinformation. Many previous studies have found a negative association between health-protective
behaviours and belief in the specific form of misinformation popularly known as 'conspiracy theory'. Concerns
have arisen regarding the spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories on social media. Methods Three
questionnaire surveys of social media use, conspiracy beliefs and health-protective behaviours with regard to
COVID-19 among UK residents were carried out online, one using a self-selecting sample (N = 949) and two using
stratified random samples from a recruited panel (N = 2250, N = 2254). Results All three studies found a negative
relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 health-protective behaviours, and a positive
relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and use of social media as a source of information about
COVID-19. Studies 2 and 3 also found a negative relationship between COVID-19 health-protective behaviours
and use of social media as a source of information, and Study 3 found a positive relationship between healthprotective
behaviours and use of broadcast media as a source of information. Conclusions When used as an
information source, unregulated social media may present a health risk that is partly but not wholly"

"Fact checking by professionals is viewed as a vital defense in the fight against misinformation. While
fact checking is important and its impact has been significant, fact checks could have limited visibility and may
not reach the intended audience, such as those deeply embedded in polarized communities. Concerned
citizens (i.e., the crowd), who are users of the platforms where misinformation appears, can play a crucial role in
disseminating fact-checking information and in countering the spread of misinformation. To explore if this is the
case, we conduct a data-driven study of misinformation on the Twitter platform, focusing on tweets related to
the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the spread of misinformation, professional fact checks, and the crowds
response to popular misleading claims about COVID-19.ln this work, we curate a dataset of false claims and
statements that seek to challenge or refute them. We train a classifier to create a novel dataset of 155,468
COVID-19-related tweets, containing 33,237 false claims and 33,413 refuting arguments. Our findings show that
professional fact-checking tweets have limited volume and reach. In contrast, we observe that the surge in
misinformation tweets results in a quick response and a corresponding increase in tweets that refute such
misinformation. More importantly, we"
"Vaccination could be an effective strategy for slowing the spread of the current coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Vaccine hesitancy could pose a serious problem for COVID-19
prevention, due to the spread of misinformation surrounding the ongoing pandemic. The aim of this
study was to assess the attitudes towards the prospective COVID-19 vaccines among the general
public in Jordan, Kuwait and other Arab countries. We also aimed to assess the association between
COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and conspiracy beliefs. This study used an online survey distributed in
December 2020, with items assessing conspiracies regarding COVID-19's origin and vaccination.
Attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines were assessed using the Vaccine Conspiracy Belief Scale (VCBS),
with higher scores indicating a greater belief in vaccine conspiracy. A total of 3414 respondents
completed the survey, the majority being residents of Jordan (n = 2173, 63.6%), Kuwait (n = 771,
22.6%} and Saudi Arabia (n = 154, 4.5%). The acceptance rates for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines
were 29.4% and 30.9%, respectively. Males, respondents with higher educational levels and those
with histories of chronic disease had higher rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Beliefs that COVID-

"Abstract Context On December 1, 2020, Drs. Wolfgang Wodarg and Michael Yeadon
petitioned to withhold emergency use authorization of the BNT162b2 messenger ribonucleic acid
vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer, raising
concern for female infertility risks but acknowledging the lack of evidence. The European Medicines
Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration ultimately issued emergency use authorizations,
but misinformation claiming that COVID-19 vaccines cause female infertility began circulating on
social media, potentially influencing public perception and medical decision making among pregnant
patients or those seeking to become pregnant. Objectives To determine the potential influence    misinformation may have had on public interest in infertility related topics, as analyzed through Both the claim and abstract address the topic of COVID-19

"The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the COVID-19 vaccine on December 11, 2020 has
been met with hesitancy for uptake with some citing potential impacts on future fertility. We
hypothesised that irrespective of sex, fertility-related queries would markedly increase during the 48
days following EUA of the coronavirus vaccine. We sought to objectively identify trends in internet
search queries on public concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine side effects on fertility that might
impact vaccine uptake. We used Google Trends to investigate queries in Google's Search Engine
3 relating to the coronavirus vaccine and fertility between 10/24/2020 and 1/27/2021. The five most
queried terms were identified as: 'COVID Vaccine Fertility', 'COVID Vaccine and Infertility', 'COVID
Vaccine Infertility', 'COVID Vaccine Fertility CDC', and 'COVID 19 Vaccine Infertility' with an increase of
710.47%, 207.56%, 264.35%, 2,943.7%, and 529.26%, respectively, all p<.001. This study indicates
that there was an increase in online COVID-19 vaccine-related queries regarding fertility side effects
coinciding with the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on December 11, 2020. Our results objectively
evidence the increased concern regarding the vaccine and likely demonstrate a major cause for
hesitancy in vaccine uptake. Future studies and counselling with patients should be undertaken to
help mitigate these ."
"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic continues to evolve, with
variants of concern and new surges of COVID-19 noted over the past months. The limited data and
evolving recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy have led to some
understandable hesitancy among pregnant individuals. On social media, misinformation and
unfounded claims linking COVID-19 vaccines to infertility are widespread, leading to vaccine
4 skepticism among many men and women of reproductive age. The disproportionate impact of COVID19
on communities of color, coupled with the unfortunate and troubled history of abuses of African
Americans by the biomedical research community in the US, has also led to hesitancy and skepticism
about the COVID-19 vaccines among some of our most vulnerable. The complex nature of vaccine
hesitancy is evidenced by further divides between different demographic, political, age, geographical,
and socioeconomic groups. Better understanding of these concerns is important in the individualized
approaches to each patient."
"Although COVID-19 vaccine access has increased nationwide, vaccination rates have been
slow-moving, with many studies showing significant vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. We conducted an
on line survey using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to identify reasons for vaccine hesitancy among
unvaccinated adults between June 30 and July 1, 2021. We found that 58% of unvaccinated
respondents were worried about unknown long-term adverse effects. Of these, 41 % believed that the
COVID-19 vaccines can negatively impact reproductive health and or fertility, and 38% were unsure of
the effects on fertility. Our study demonstrates that fear regarding COVID-19 vaccine adverse effects
and belief that they can negatively impact fertility is a major cause of vaccine hesitancy in the United States. We identified that urban residents, married individuals, those born outside the U.S., those
with health insurance, and people with higher education and income greater than $100,000 felt that
the vaccine would affect fertility more than their counterparts did. Finally, we found that 48% of
unvaccinated respondents cited 'more information and research conducted on the COVID-19
vaccines' as the action that would most encourage vaccine uptake"
"COVID-19 vaccines have met varying levels of acceptance and hesitancy in different parts of
the world, which has implications for eliminating the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this systematic
review is to examine how and why the rates of COVlD-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy differ
across countries and continents. PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and Science Direct were
searched between 1 January 2020 and 31 July 2021 using keywords such as ""COVID-19 vaccine
acceptance"". 81 peer-reviewed publications were found to be eligible for review. The analysis shows
6 that there are global variations in vaccine acceptance among different populations. The vaccineacceptance
rates were the highest amongst adults in Ecuador {97%}, Malaysia {94.3%} and Indonesia
(93.3%} and the lowest amongst adults in Lebanon (21.0%}. The general healthcare workers (HCWs) in
China (86.20%) and nurses in Italy (91.50%} had the highest acceptance rates, whereas HCWs in the
Democratic Republic of Congo had the lowest acceptance (27.70%). A nonparametric one-way ANOVA
showed that the differences in vaccine-acceptance rates were statistically significant (H(49)= 75.302,
p = 0.009) between the analyzed countries. However, the reasons behind vaccine hesitancy and
acceptance were similar across the board. Low vaccine acceptance was associated with low levels"
"ABSTRACT Introduction COVID-19 has had a catastrophic impact on the world. The current
death toll far exceeds 6 million and large numbers of patients are experiencing long-term medical and
psychiatric morbidity from the infection. The immunopathology of severe COVID-19 is now better
understood. In severely affected patients, there is a chaotic, destructive immune response triggered
by SARS-CoV-2, where autoimmunity features prominently. Areas covered COVID-19 vaccines ensure a
coordinated, balanced immune response to future SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rapid global
deployment of effective COVID-19 vaccines has been hindered by financial, logistical and political
barriers. Of concern is increasing vaccine hesitancy caused by unfounded conspiracy theories of
vaccine adverse effects, often fueled by misinformation and disinformation on social media. Expert
opinion This perspective discusses the potential impact of the so-called
Autoimmune/autoinflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants (ASIA) on COVID-19 vaccine uptake.
Proponents of the ASIA syndrome have inappropriately linked infertility to HPV vaccines and have
recently suggested antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and ovarian follicles. COVID-19
vaccines have also been linked to ASIA and unfounded fear of infertility is a leading cause of vaccine
hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy caused by spurious disorders such as ASIA are likely to harm individuals
and delay global vaccination efforts leading"

with men being at a larger risk than women. There have been few publications on the andrological
consequences of COVID-19 and its vaccines so far. To assuage vaccine fear stemming from concerns
about fertility, the effect of inactivated whole-virus and viral vector vaccines on semen quality was
investigated in 100 Egyptian men. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines on semen parameters was
validated with no significant change in pre- and post-vaccination semen analyses in either type of
vaccine. Following COVID-19 vaccination, we can declare male semen parameters as unaffected"
"The pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a disease caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Older age and
presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity significantly increases the risk for hospitalization

respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and the current literature on SARS-CoV-2, we discuss potential
mechanisms by which diabetes modulates the host-viral interactions and host-immune responses. We hope
to highlight gaps in knowledge that require further studies pertinent to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes."
"Diabetes is one of the most distinct co morbidities of COVID-19. Here, we describe the
clinical characteristics of and outcomes in patients with diabetes in whom COVID-19 was confirmed or
clinically diagnosed (with typical features on lung imaging and symptoms) and their association with
glucose-lowering or blood pressure-lowering medications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this
retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical
and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group
without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications. Logistic regression was used to explore
risk factors associated with mortality or poor prognosis. RESULTS The proportion of comorbid diabetes is
similar between cases of confirmed and of clinically diagnosed COVID-19. Risk factors for higher mortality of
patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09 [95% Cl 1.04, 1.15] per
year increase; P = 0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (aOR 1.12 [95% Cl 1.00, 1.24]; P = 0.043). Insulin
usage (a OR 3.58 [95% Cl 1.37, 9.35]; P = 0.009) was associated with poor prognosis. Clinical outcomes of

"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common and important risk factors for severe health
outcomes related to coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19). Data from the French Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and
Diabetes Outcomes (CORONADO) study in patients with COVID-19 infection showed that higher body mass
index (BMI) and complications of diabetes were associated with disease severity and death, but they did not
identify a link between glycaemic control and mortality. However, other studies found an association
between HbAlc level and COVID-19-related death, suggesting poor glycaemic control as a potential risk
factor for mortality. Establishing the exact nature and magnitude of the association between glycaemic
control and COVID-19 severity is critical to inform appropriate glucose management strategies in people
with diabetes, such as selecting an appropriate HbAlc target to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19.
Appropriate methodologies must be used to investigate the impact of preinfection HbAlc on COVID-19
severity. First, HbAlc should be measured before the onset of COVID-19 infection, so as not to confuse a risk
factor (baseline glycaemic control) with a complication of the disease (infection related hyperglycaemia).
Second, preinfection HbAlc should be modelled as a continuous exposure. Models using preinfection HbAlc"
"Although child vaccination rates remain high, some parental concern persists that vaccines might cause
autism. Three specific hypotheses have been proposed: (1) the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes
autism by damaging the intestinal lining, which allows the entrance of encephalopathic proteins; (2) thimerosal, an
ethylmercury-containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system; and (3) the
simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system. We will discuss the
genesis of each of these theories and review the relevant epidemiological evidence"
"To test the effectiveness of messages designed to reduce vaccine misperceptions and increase
vaccination rates for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR). METHODS: A Web-based nationally representative 2-wave survey
experiment was conducted with 1759 parents age 18 years and older residing in the United States who have children
in their household age 17 years or younger (conducted June-July 2011). Parents were randomly assigned to receive 1
of 4 interventions: (1) information explaining the lack of evidence that MMR causes autism from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention; (2) textual information about the dangers of the diseases prevented by MMR from the
Vaccine Information Statement; (3) images of children who have diseases prevented by the MMR vaccine; (4) a
dramatic narrative about an infant who almost died of measles from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact
sheet; or to a control group. RESULTS: None of the interventions increased parental intent to vaccinate a future child.

"Purpose of review Autism is a biologically based disorder of brain development. Genetic factors mutations,
deletions, and copy number variants - are clearly implicated in causation of autism. However, they account
for only a small fraction of cases, and do not easily explain key clinical and epidemiological features. This suggests
that early environmental exposures also contribute. This review explores this hypothesis. Recent findings Indirect
evidence for an environmental contribution to autism comes from studies demonstrating the sensitivity of the
developing brain to external exposures such as lead, ethyl alcohol and methyl mercury. But the most powerful proofof-
concept evidence derives from studies specifically linking autism to exposures in early pregnancy- thalidomide,
misoprostol, and valproic acid; maternal rubella infection; and the organophosphate insecticide, chlorpyrifos. There is
no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism. Summary Expanded research is needed into environmental
causation of autism. Children today are surrounded by thousands of synthetic chemicals. Two hundred of them are
neurotoxic in adult humans, and 1000 more in laboratory models. Yet fewer than 20% of high-volume chemicals have
been tested for neurodevelopmental toxicity. I propose a targeted discovery strategy focused on suspect chemicals,
which combines expanded toxicological screening, neurobiological research and prospective epidemiological... ["
"An hypothesis published in 1998 suggested that measles-mumps-rubella vaccine may cause autism as a
result of persistent measles virus infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Results of early studies were not supportive
and in 2001 a review by the Institute of Medicine concluded that the evidence favors the rejection of a causal
relationship at the population level between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autistic spectrum disorder. Studies
published since the lnstitue of Medicine report have continued not to find an increased risk of autistic spectrum
disorder associated with measles-mumps-rubella. The vaccine also has not been found to be associated with a
unique syndrome of developmental regression and gastrointestinal disorders. The evidence now is convincing that
the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine does not cause autism or any particular subtypes of autistic spectrum disorder"
"The hypothesized link between the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism continues to cause
concern and challenge vaccine acceptance almost 2 decades after the controversial and later retracted Lancet paper
from 1998 (1), even though observational studies have not been able to identify an increased risk for autism after MMR
vaccination. In a 2014 meta-analysis, 10 observational studies on childhood vaccines were identified: 5 cohort studies
and 5 casecontrol studies (2). Of these, 2 cohort studies and 4 casecontrol studies specifically addressed MMR and
autism, all reporting no association. This is consistent with more recent studies of note (3, 4). We previously addressed
this issue in a nationwide cohort study of 537303 Danish children with 738 cases of autism spectrum disorders (5). In
our cohort, MMR vaccination was not associated with autistic disorder (rate ratio, 0.92 [95% Cl, 0.68 to 1.24]) or other
autism spectrum disorders (rate ratio, 0.83 [Cl, 0.65 to 1.07]). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association again
in a more recent and nonoverlapping cohort of Danish children that has greater statistical power owing to more
children, more cases, and longer follow-up. A criticism of our and other previous observational studies has"

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) has a variable clinical presentation that ranges from
asymptomatic, to severe disease with cytokine storm. The mortality rates also differ across the globe, ranging from 0.5-13%. This
variation is likely due to both pathogen and host factors. Host factors may include genetic differences in the immune response genes
as well as variation in HLA and KIR allotypes. To better understand what impact these genetic variants in immune response genes
may have in the differences observed in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, a quantitative analysis of a dynamical systems model
that considers both, the magnitude of viral growth, and the subsequent innate and adaptive response required to achieve control of
infection is considered. Based on this broad quantitative framework it may be posited that the spectrum of symptomatic to severely
symptomatic presentations of COVID19 represents the balance between innate and adaptive immune responses. In asymptomatic
patients, prompt and adequate adaptive immune response quells infection, whereas in those with severe symptoms a slower
inadequate adaptive response leads to a runaway cytokine cascade fueled by ongoing viral replication. Polymorphisms in the
various components of the innate and adaptive immune response may cause altered immune response kinetics"

Whilst for most, their anxiety will be proportionate to the threat, for some, existing pre-occupation with physical symptoms and
illness will become more problematic. There is a growing body of evidence that health anxiety may occur in childhood, however
much of the literature is taken from research using adult samples. This practitioner review aims to give an overview of the

debated and important to optimize. As of late August 2021, recommendations on the use of these vaccines in children vary across
different countries. Recommendations are more uniform for vaccines in young adults, but vaccination uptake in this age group
shows a large range across countries. Mandates for vaccination of university students are a particularly debated topic with many

"There is increasing research evidence about the causal role of alcohol in cancer, accompanied by unclear
and conflicting messages in the media. This paper aimed to clarify the strength of the evidence for alcohol
as a cause of cancer, and the meaning of cause in this context.
METHODS
Recent epidemiological and biological research on alcohol and cancer was reviewed and summarized,
drawing upon published meta-analyses identified from the Med line database and the archives of the
International Agency for Research on Cancer. More recent epidemiological studies not included in these
publications were also reviewed. A brief description of the nature of causal inference in epidemiology was
used to frame discussion of the strength of the evidence that alcohol causes cancer, and contrast this with
the case for a protective association of alcohol with cardiovascular disease.
RESULTS
The usual epidemiological understanding of a cause is a factor that increases the incidence of a condition
in the population. In the context of a body of epidemiological evidence of an association of alcohol
consumption with a disease, the inference that it is a causal association requires alternative explanations
of the observed finding to be judged unlikely. Even without complete knowledge of biological
mechanisms, the epidemiological evidence ."
"This is a review of the epidemiologic literature on alcohol and risks of various cancers. Alcohol
has consistently been related to risks of squamous cell carcinomas of the mouth, oral pharynx, larynx, and
esophagus in multiple studies of varying design. The joint effects of alcohol and smoking are greater than
additive, and are probably multiplicative, suggesting biological synergism. All major types of alcoholic
beverages have been casually implicated in the genesis of these diseases. The influence of alcohol on risks
of upper aerodigestive tract cancers may be greater in persons with marginal nutritional status than in
better-nourished individuals. Alcohol also has been associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinomas
of the esophagus, gastro-esophageal junction, and gastric cardia, but the relationship is not as strong as
for squamous cell esophageal carcinomas. Alcohol and tobacco account for over 80% of the squamous
carcinomas of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus in the United States. Risks of cancers of the

"Knowledge that alcohol can cause cancer is low in Canada. Alcohol labels are one strategy for
communicating alcohol-related harms, including cancer. Extending existing research observing an
association between knowledge of the alcohol-cancer link and support for alcohol policies, this study
examined whether increases in individual-level knowledge that alcohol is a carcinogen following an
alcohol labelling intervention are associated with support for alcohol polices. Cancer warning labels were
applied to alcohol containers at the intervention site, and the comparison site did not apply cancer labels.
Pre-post surveys were conducted among liquor store patrons at both sites before and two-and six-months
after the intervention was stopped due to alcohol industry interference. Limiting the data to participants
that completed surveys both before and two-months after the cancer label stopped, logistic regression
was used to examine the association between increases in knowledge and support for policies. Support
for pricing and availability policies was low overall; however, increases in individual-level knowledge of
the alcohol-cancer link was associated with higher levels of support for pricing policies, specifically,
setting a minimum unit price per standard drink of alcohol (OR= 1.86, 95% Cl: 1.11-3.12). Improving
knowledge that alcohol can cause cancer using labels may increase support for ..."
"Approximately 4% of cancers worldwide are caused by alcohol consumption. Drinking alcohol
increases the risk of several cancer types, including cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, liver,
colorectum, and breast. In this review, we summarise the epidemiological evidence on alcohol and cancer
risk and the mechanistic evidence of alcohol-mediated carcinogenesis. There are several mechanistic
pathways by which the consumption of alcohol, as ethanol, is known to cause cancer, though some are
still not fully understood. Ethanol's metabolite acetaldehyde can cause DNA damage and block DNA"
"Alcoholic beverages are carcinogenic to humans. Globally, an estimated 4.1 % of new cancer
cases in 2020 were attributable to alcoholic beverages. However, the full cancer burden due to alcohol is
uncertain because for many cancer (sub)types, associations remain inconclusive. Additionally,
associations of consumption with therapeutic response, disease progression, and long-term cancer
outcomes are not fully understood, public awareness of the alcohol-cancer link is low, and the
interrelationships of alcohol control regulations and cancer risk are unclear. In December 2020, the U.S.
NCI convened a workshop and public webinar that brought together a panel of scientific experts to review
what is known about and identify knowledge gaps regarding alcohol and cancer. Examples of gaps
identified include: (i) associations of alcohol consumption patterns across the life course with cancer risk;
(ii) alcohol's systemic carcinogenic effects; (iii) alcohol's influence on treatment efficacy, patient-reported
outcomes, and long-term prognosis; (iv) communication strategies to increase awareness of the alcoholcancer
link; and (v) the impact of alcohol control policies to reduce consumption on cancer incidence and
mortality. Interdisciplinary research and implementation efforts are needed to increase relevant
knowledge, and to develop effective interventions focused on improving awareness, and reducing
harmful consumption to decrease the alcohol-related cancer burden"
"A deficiency in the essential nutrient thiamine resulting from chronic alcohol consumption is one
factor underlying alcohol-induced brain damage. Thiamine is a helper molecule (i.e., a cofactor) required by
three enzymes involved in two pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. Because intermediate products of
these pathways are needed for the generation of other essential molecules in the cells (e.g., building blocks of
proteins and DNA as well as brain chemicals), a reduction in thiamine can interfere with numerous cellular
functions, leading to serious brain disorders, including Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is found
predominantly in alcoholics. Chronic alcohol consumption can result in thiamine deficiency by causing
inadequate nutritional thiamine intake, decreased absorption of thiamine from the gastrointestinal tract, and
impaired thiamine utilization in the cells. People differ in their susceptibility to thiamine deficiency, however,
and different brain regions also may be more or less sensitive to this condition"
"Alcohol is eliminated from the body by various metabolic mechanisms. The primary enzymes
involved are aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), cytochrome P450 (CYP2El), and
catalase. Variations in the genes for these enzymes have been found to influence alcohol consumption,
alcohol-related tissue damage, and alcohol dependence. The consequences of alcohol metabolism include
oxygen deficits (i.e., hypoxia) in the liver; interaction between alcohol metabolism byproducts and other cell
components, resulting in the formation of harmful compounds (i.e., adducts); formation of highly reactive
oxygen-containing molecules (i.e., reactive oxygen species [ROS]) that can damage other cell components;
changes in the ratio of NADH to NAD+ (i.e., the cell's redox state); tissue damage; fetal damage; impairment of
other metabolic processes; cancer; and medication interactions. Several issues related to alcohol metabolism
require further research."
"There are multiple mechanisms by which alcohol can damage the developing brain, but the type of
damage induced will depend on the amount and developmental timing of exposure, along with other
maternal and genetic factors. This article reviews current perspectives on how ethanol can produce
neuroteratogenic effects by its interactions with molecular regulators of brain development. The current
evidence suggests that alcohol produces many of its damaging effects by exerting specific actions on
molecules that regulate key developmental processes (e.g., L1 cell adhesion molecule, alcohol
dehydrogenase, catalase), interfering with the early development of mid line serotonergic neurons and
disrupting their regulatory-signaling function for other target brain structures, interfering with trophic factors
that regulate neurogenesis and cell survival, or inducing excessive cell death via oxidative stress or activation
of caspase-3 proteases. The current understanding of pathogenesis mechanisms suggests several strategic
approaches to develop rational molecular prevention. However, the development of behavioral and biologic
treatments for alcohol-affected children is crucial because it is unlikely that effective delivery of preventative
interventions can realistically be achieved in ways to prevent prenatal damage in at-risk pregnancies. Toward
that end, behavioral training that promotes experience-dependent neuroplasticity has been effective in a rat
model of cerebellar damage induced"
"Background:Millions of neonates undergo anesthesia each year. Certain anesthetic agents cause
brain cell death and long-term neurocognitive dysfunction in postnatal day (P)7 rats. Despite its intuitive
appeal, a causal link between cell death and neurocognitive decline after anesthesia has not been
established. If one existed, the degree of cell death would be expected to correlate with the degree of
neurocognitive dysfunction caused by anesthesia. The authors therefore tested if cell death caused by various
durations of isoflurane at 1 minimum alveolar concentration causes duration-dependent long-term
neurocognitive dysfunction. Methods:lsoflurane was administered to P7 rats at 1 minimum alveolar
concentration for 0, 1, 2, or 4 h. To control for the respiratory depressant effects of anesthesia, a group of rats
was treated with 4 h of carbon dioxide. Cell death was assessed by FluoroJade staining 12 h after the end of
each intervention, and neurocognitive outcome was assessed 8 weeks later by using fear conditioning, spatial
reference memory, and spatial working memory tasks. Results:Widespread brain cell death was caused by 2 h
and 4 h of isoflurane and by 4 h of carbon dioxide. The degree and distribution of thalamic cell death was
similar in 4 h isoflurane-treated and 4-h carbon dioxide-treated ."
"The consequences of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy on the outcome of offspring depend,
among other factors, on the amount and pattern of alcohol consumption. Animal studies found that bingelike
drinking patterns, in which the fetus is exposed to high blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) over relatively
short periods of time, are particularly harmful, even if the overall alcohol amount consumed is less than those
of more continuous drinking patterns. Long-term studies in humans have confirmed that children of bingedrinking
mothers exhibited especially severe cognitive and behavioral deficits. Binge drinking may be
particularly harmful because it results in high BACs, may occur during critical periods of brain development,
and may be associated with repeated withdrawal episodes"
"Together, the first two editions of Buzzed have sold over 120,000 copies'and now the authors have
revised and updated the book to include the most recent discoveries about drugs, including new information
on the energy drinks craze, prescription drugs such as OxyContin and Ambien, and the date-rape drug GHB.
Scientifically accurate and easy to read, this no-nonsense handbook gives the most balanced, objective
information available on the most often used and abused drugs, from alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine to
heroin, Ecstasy, and methamphetamine. In both quick-reference summaries and in-depth analysis, it reports
on how these drugs enter the body, how they manipulate the brain, their short-term and long-term effects the kinds of 'high' they produce, and the circumstances in which they can be deadly. Neither a 'Just Say No'
treatise nor a 'How to' manual, Buzzed is based on the conviction that people make better decisions with
accurate information at hand."
"Alcohol and caffeine are deeply woven into the fabric of life for most of the world's population, as
close and as comfortable as a cup of coffee or a can of beer. Yet for most people they remain as mysterious
and unpredictable as the spirits they were once thought to be. Now, in Buzz, Stephen Braun takes us on a
myth-shattering tour of these two popular substances, one that blends fascinating science with colorful lore,
and that includes cameo appearances by Shakespeare and Balzac, Buddhist monks and Arabian goat herders,
even Mikhail Gorbachev and David Letterman (who once quipped, 'If it weren't for the coffee, I'd have no
identifiable personality whatsoever'). Much of what Braun reveals directly contradicts conventional wisdom
about alcohol and caffeine. Braun shows, for instance, that alcohol is not simply a depressant as popularly
believed, but is instead 'a pharmacy in a bottle'- mimicking the action of drugs such as cocaine,
amphetamine, valium, and opium. At low doses, it increases electrical activity in the same brain systems
affected by stimulants, influences the same circuits targeted by valium, and causes the release of morphinelike
compounds known as endorphins - all at the same time. This explains why"
"Chronic heavy drinking and alcoholism can have serious repercussions for the functioning of the
entire nervous system, particularly the brain. These effects include changes in emotions and personality as
well as impaired perception, learning, and memory. Neuropathological and imaging techniques have
provided evidence of physical brain abnormalities in alcoholics, such as atrophy of nerve cells and brain
shrinkage. At the cellular level, alcohol appears to directly affect brain function in a variety of ways, primarily
by interfering with the action of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and other neurotransmitters.
Neurological disorders also can result from vitamin deficiency and liver disease, two health problems that
commonly occur with alcoholism. Other hypotheses, based on factors such as aging, gender, and genetics,
have been developed to explain various alcohol-related neurological consequences. Many pharmacological
treatments to improve neuropsychological functioning in alcoholics have been tested, but none has proved
entirely successful. With prolonged abstinence"

"To investigate the association between various risk factors and precancerous lesion of gastric cancer (PLGC) in patients from
eastern China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
501 cases of PLGC and 523 cases of superficial gastritis were included. A comparative study of the relation between different
risk factors and PGLC was performed RESULTS
Statistical differences were noted in a series of indexes including Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, family history of esophageal
cancer (EC), gastric cancer (GC) and chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), a history of CAG, gastric polyps (GP) and gastric ulcer (GU),
usage of non-steroids (e.g., aspirin), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), consuming alcohol, eating food rich in nitroso
compounds, irregular eating habits with no breakfast, ingestion of smoked meat, fried food and spicy food, anxiety and
depression. The risk factors associated with PLGC ranked in an order of a history of CAG, GP, family history of GC, usage of nonsteroids
(e.g., aspirin), ingestion of spicy food frequently, HP infection, family history of EC, consuming alcohol, anxiety, a
history of GU, GERD and family history of CAG.
CONCLUSIONS
A history of CAG was most associated with PLGC in patients from eastern China, followed by a history of GP and family history of
GC."
"Background Peptic ulcer disease is a multifactorial health problem, and its prevalence and risk factors have changed
considerably within the past century. Objective To determine the prevalence of peptic ulcer among the population of Arar city
and to identify risk factors for peptic ulcer and to estimate their relative impact on ulcer incidence. Methods A cross-sectional
study was carried out on the population of Arar city, Northern Saudi Arabia from November 01, 2016 to April 30, 2017. Data were
analyzed by SPSS version 16, using descriptive statistics, prevalence, and Chi-square test. Results Total prevalence of peptic
ulcer among the studied respondents was thus: 21.9% had peptic ulcer; 16.2% gastric ulcer and 5.6% duodenal ulcer. In 19.7%
of the cases, the pain was severe, 92.4% reported that pain was precipitated by certain food. In addition to heartburn, 78.8%
reported loss of appetite, 71.2% indigestion, 66.7% regurgitation, 59.1 % nausea and vomiting and 42.4% with chest pain.
Regarding the risk factors, coffee drinking came in first place (81.8%) followed by physical stress in 77.3%, spicy food in 57.6%,

"This review examines Helicobacter pylori as an organism and as the causative agent of peptic ulcers. The review also
examined the classification of ulcers, how the bacterium produces the ulcer, some of the virulence factors possessed by the
organism, its metabolism and growth requirements. The incidence and prevalence of peptic ulcers were originally believed to
have resulted from some factors such as stress, eating spicy food, long term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents
(NSAIDs), like aspirin and ibuprofen, smoking, and many alike. presently due to the development in the field of research,
researchers from different geographical locations have reported a spiralshaped Gram-negative bacterium called Helicobacter
pylori to be responsible for the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer. This confirmation has been supported by the strong and effective
diagnostic procedures such as urea breath test, stool test, endoscopy, and blood test. Elimination of Helicobacter pylori by
treatment with antibiotics in peptic ulcer patients resulted in the healing of the ulcer. Prevention of Helicobacter pylori
infections is difficult because the mode of transmission is not well known. Key words: Helicobacter pylori, peptic ulcer,
causative agent. ["
"Abstract Background Previous case-control studies have reported positive associations of spicy food consumption with risks of certain gastrointestinal-tract (GI} cancers. However, there is no prospective evidence on such associations,
particularly from China, where there are high incidence rates of GI cancers and spicy food is widely consumed. Methods The
prospective China Kadoorie Biobank study recruited >512 000 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 areas in China during 2004-
2008; 2350 oesophageal, 3350 stomach and 3061 colorectal incident cancer cases were recorded by 1 January 2017, after a
median of 10.1 years of follow-up. Cox regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for each cancer associated with spicy
food intake. Results Overall, 30% of participants reported daily spicy food consumption at baseline. Spicy food consumption
was inversely associated with oesophageal cancer risk, with adjusted H Rs of 1.00, 0.88, 0.76, 0.84 and 0.81 for those who
never/rarely consumed (reference) and consumed monthly, 1-2 days/week, 3-5 days/week and 6-7 days/week, respectively
(ptrend < 0.002). The association remained similar after excluding the first 3 years of follow-up but appeared stronger in
participants who did not smoke or drink alcohol regularly (ptrend < 0.0001). The corresponding HRs for stomach cancer were
1.00, 0.97, 0.95, 0.92 and 0.89 (ptrend =0.04), with the association disappearing after excluding the first 3 years of"
"There is increasing scholarly interest in the history of routine male circumcision in Anglophone
countries, but much disagreement as to whether prevention of masturbation was an important part of this
development. A review of the historiography of both the masturbation phobia and the rise of routine
circumcision shows that it has been widely accepted since the 1950s that discouraging masturbation was a
major reason why doctors, educationists and childcare experts sought to introduce circumcision of both boys
and girls in the later nineteenth century, a campaign which was successful in the former case, unsuccessful in
the latter-an outcome which still colours popular concepts about what constitutes genital mutilation.
Mainstream pediatric and child care manuals continued to assert the value of circumcision as a disincentive
to masturbation right up until the 1950s. The importance of the original link between masturbation and
circumcision was rediscovered at the same time, when belief in the harmful effects of the former was
declining, and as medical historians began to investigate the origin, course and effects of the onanism scare
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries"
"Abstract Each generation has adopted views on masturbation via transforming cultural definitions
of sexuality and normality. This article presents how masturbation habits have changed during the last
decades in different generations and how these habits are linked to the partnership status. The analysis is
based on three national follow-up sex surveys in Finland (in 1971, in 1992, and in 1999), and sex surveys in
Sweden (in 1996), in Estonia (in 2000), and in St. Petersburg, Russia (in 1996). Across these countries, each
new generation had been more active in masturbation than the previous one. However, in Estonia
masturbation had increased in each generation about 20 years later and in St. Petersburg about 30 years later
than in Finland and Sweden. The increase in masturbation was almost unrelated to the relationship status
and to the years spent in the relationship. The masturbation habits that each generation had internalized in
adolescence seemed to remain unchanged through the course of their lives. The implications of these
findings are that masturbation did not decrease with age and that masturbation was not a compensation for
a missing sex partner but an independent way to gain sexual pleasure. The results indicate that masturbation
is linked to"
"Abstract In order to investigate the association between masturbation and psychopathological and
reproduction relative conditions, an on line survey was conducted among campus male students of Zhejiang
University, which comprised of basic personal information, and questions for reproduction related health,
masturbation frequency, and psychological well-being. Psychological status was evaluated with Middlesex
Hospital Questionnaire (MHQ). The psychological and reproduction health related parameters were
compared among the groups divided according to masturbation frequency. Finally 143 students were
included in analysis. Floating anxiety, somatic, and hysteric scores were significantly associated with
masturbation, with higher scores in group with highest masturbation frequency; masturbation is significantly
associated with fatigue, soreness and weakness of the lumbar region, memory decline, immunity decline,
insomnia dreaminess and gradual increase of frequency of masturbation, and the rates of most of the
reproduction related symptoms increased accompanying the increase of the masturbation frequency. MQH
scores of obsession, phobic anxiety, and depression were not associated with masturbation. It was
concluded that masturbation may adversely affect psychological health as well as reproductive well-being"

"Green tea (from the plant Camellia sinensis), a beverage whose consumption started 5000 years ago in China,
has important biological and pharmacological properties. The beneficial effects of green tea have been attributed to the
presence of phenolic compounds that are powerful anti-oxidants and free iron scavengers. Of all the catechins found in
green tea, namely (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate, (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epicatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(EGCG), EGCG is the most abundant and powerful. It is widely believed that green tea may protect against death from all
causes, especially cardiovascular diseases neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). Thus far,
numerous pharmacological activities regulating disease-specific molecular targets have been reported in vitro for EGCG
concentrations in the micromolar range, which are physiologically irrelevan"

in cell, animal, and human studies. Green tea, green tea catechins, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) have been
demonstrated in cell culture and animal models of obesity to reduce adipocyte differentiation and proliferation,
lipogenesis, fat mass, body weight, fat absorption, plasma levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, cholesterol, glucose,
insulin and leptin, as well as to increase beta-oxidation and thermogenesis. Adipose tissue, liver, intestine, and skeletal
muscle are target organs of green tea, mediating its anti-obesity effects. Studies conducted with human subjects report
reduced body weight and body fat, as well as increased fat oxidation and thermogenesis and thereby confirm findings in
cell culture systems and animal models of obesity. There is still a need for well-designed and controlled clinical studies to
validate the existing and encouraging human studies. Since EGCG is regarded as the most active component of green tea,
its specific effects on obesity should also be investigated in human trials."

"The most consumed beverage in the world is tea after water. Till today the consumption of black tea is 70%
while that of green tea is only 20%. One reason for this percentage is lack of awareness about green tea and invested
research. Green tea along with caffeine which imparts characteristic taste, bitterness and stimulating effect, is also rich in a
group of chemicals, called Catechin Polyphenols (Commonly known as Tannins, which contribute to bitter taste and
astringency) and deliver antioxidant properties. Furthermore, green tea also comprises of amino acids such as Thea nine

like vitamin A, vitamin Bl, vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin C and vitamin E are also found in green tea. The present review
gives the study of various constituents of green tea and their impact on human health. Studies provide strong evidence
that owing to antioxidant properties daily intake of green tea may be used as a preventive measure for different types of

"When we were children, our mothers told us that ""eating an apple a day keeps the doctor
away,"" that ""carrots contribute to good eyesight,"" and we saw ""Popeye"" gain amazing strength from
consuming cans of spinach. This was reinforced by please ""eat your vegetables; they are good for you,""
but we also remember that food and vitamins that were good for us often did not taste very good!
Regardless, these appeals were effective. Spinach growers credited Popeye with a 33% increase in U.S.
spinach consumption- and saving the spinach industry in the 1930s (King Features, 2006). Fast forward to
the 21st century. Now many consumers have moved past accepting generalities and want to know the
dietary and health contributions of specific food products. There is a significant and growing market
segment that is concerned with consuming a diet that will reduce the incidence of important sources of

"Purpose To report parents' awareness and perception of eye diseases in their children. Methods
Thirty-five parents and 16 eye care practitioners either participated in in-depth interviews or focus group
discussions. Data on parents' awareness and perception were collected using interview guides with
unstructured questions. Data were transcribed, familiarized, and coded, and themes were generated.
Redundancy was considered as the end point of data collection. Results The study results conveyed that
parents were aware of common eye problems like refractive error, squint, and cataract, except for
amblyopia, in their children. The causative factors for ocular diseases were not well understood by
parents. The parents' perception was that eye problems can be treated with food, such as eggs or carrots,
and exercises. Most of the parents perceived squint as a sign of good luck and spectacle correction as a
social stigma. Conclusions One of the prerequisites of health-seeking behavior is knowledge of disease
and their symptoms, which seems to be lacking in parents of children. The findings of this study suggest
that programs to increase awareness of the causative factors, spectacle wearing, and on the harmful
effects of squint should be conducted."
"Carrot is a root vegetable with carotenoids, flavonoids, polyacetylenes, vitamins, and minerals,

"Consumers try to avoid temptation when exposed to appetizing foods by diverting their
attention away from their senses (e.g., sight, smell, mouthfeel) and bodily states (e.g., state of arousal,
salivation) in order to focus on their longer term goals (e.g., eating healthily, achieving an ideal body
weight). However, when not including sensations in their decision-making processes, consumers risk
depleting their self-regulatory resources, potentially leading to unhealthy food choices. Conversely, based
on the concept of ""embodied self-regulation,"" the suggestion is made that considering bodily states may
help consumers regulate their food choices more effectively. A new model is proposed that facilitates
understanding observed consumer behavior and the success or failure of self-control in food intake. It is
argued that bodily states and sensory information should be considered when modeling consumer
behavior and developing health-related advocacy and communication campaigns. The model proposed
here leads to new perspectives on consumer consumption behavior and health policy research and

The Six Flags of Scientific Thinking. *Extraordinary Claims tells us that extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence. For Example: The claim that a monster, like Bigfoot, has been living in the
American Northwest for decades without being discovered by researchers requires more rigorous

wrong but it is unfalsifiable because no evidence could conceivably disprove it. Occam's Razor (Also
called the ""principle of parsimony""). If two explanations for a phenomenon are equally good, we should
